NAME
       Tk::WidgetDump - dump the widget hierarchie

SYNOPSIS
           use Tk::WidgetDump;
           $mw = new MainWindow;
           $mw->WidgetDump;

DESCRIPTION
       Tk::WidgetDump helps in debugging Perl/Tk applications. By
       calling the WidgetDump method, a new toplevel with the
       widget hierarchie will be displayed. The hierarchie can
       always be refreshed by the Refresh button (e.g. if new
       widgets are added after calling the WidgetDump method).

       By double-clicking on a widget entry, the widget flashes a
       new toplevel is opened containing the configuration
       options of the widget.  It also displays other
       characteristics of the widget like children and parent
       widgets, size, position and server parameters.
       Configuration values can also be changed on the fly. For more
       possible actions, see the man page or try it yourself.
