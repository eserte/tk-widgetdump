    widget hierarchie will be displayed. The hierarchie can
    always be refreshed by the Refresh button (e.g. if new
    widgets are added after calling the WidgetDump method).
    
    By double-clicking on a widget entry, the widget flashes a
    new toplevel is opened containing the configuration
    options of the widget.	It also displays other
    characteristics of the widget like children and parent
    widgets, size, position and server parameters.
    Configuration values can also be changed on the fly. For more
    possible actions, see the man page or try it yourself.
